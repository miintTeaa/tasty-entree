# tasty-ntree
Generic rust n-trees implemented with generics and no dependencies (and that's a guarantree).

An [entr√©e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entr%C3%A9e) is a dish that is served before a meal.

An [n-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree) however, is better explained by clicking the link, which will take you to wikipedia.

Docs are included (via `cargo doc` or reading the source), and when I publish the crate I'll include a link to the docs.rs page here.
